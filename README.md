# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Image Generation Using TensorFlow

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** using **TensorFlow** for image generation. The GAN consists of two primary components:

1. **Discriminator**: A neural network tasked with determining whether the images are real or generated.
2. **Generator**: A neural network that generates fake images from random noise.

The project uses the **MNIST dataset** to train the GAN model and applies various techniques like **Leaky ReLU**, **Batch Normalization**, and **Convolutional Layers**.

## Key Components

### 1. **Discriminator Model**:

* The Discriminator is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies images as real or fake.
* It uses multiple layers of **Convolutional Layers**, **MaxPooling**, and **Leaky ReLU** activations.

### 2. **Generator Model**:

* The Generator generates fake images from random noise.
* It uses **Dense Layers**, **Batch Normalization**, **Reshape** to convert random noise vectors into image-like data.

### 3. **Training the GAN**:

* The **GAN** is trained in an adversarial manner, where the **Discriminator** tries to classify real images as real and fake images as fake, while the **Generator** tries to fool the Discriminator by generating realistic fake images.
* The loss functions used for the Discriminator and Generator are computed using **Binary Cross-Entropy**.

### 4. **Loss Functions**:

* **Discriminator Loss**: Measures how well the Discriminator distinguishes between real and fake images.
* **Generator Loss**: Measures how well the Generator can fool the Discriminator.

### 5. **Training Loop**:

* During each epoch, the **Discriminator** and **Generator** are updated iteratively.
* The loss for both models is computed, gradients are calculated, and optimizers are used to update the weights.

### 6. **Evaluation**:

* The modelâ€™s performance is monitored and evaluated using visualizations of generated images and the model's ability to distinguish real vs fake data.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the code.
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Ensure you have access to the **MNIST dataset**. The dataset will be automatically downloaded during the training.

## How to Run

1. Run the script `run_gan.py` to train the GAN model. The script will automatically download the MNIST dataset and start the training process.
2. The model will output generated images every few iterations during training.

```bash
python run_gan.py
```

## Functions

### `show_images(images)`

Displays a grid of images from the provided batch.

### `preprocess_img(x)` and `deprocess_img(x)`

Preprocesses and deprocesses images, respectively, to scale the image values to the range of \[-1, 1].

### `discriminator()`

Defines the **Discriminator** model using **Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNNs).

### `generator(noise_dim=NOISE_DIM)`

Defines the **Generator** model that takes random noise vectors and generates images.

### `discriminator_loss(logits_real, logits_fake)` and `generator_loss(logits_fake)`

Calculates the **discriminator** and **generator** loss, respectively, using **Binary Cross-Entropy**.

### `get_solvers(learning_rate=1e-3, beta1=0.5)`

Creates **Adam** optimizers for the Generator and Discriminator with the specified learning rate and beta parameters.

### `run_a_gan(D, G, D_solver, G_solver, discriminator_loss, generator_loss, num_epochs=10)`

Trains the GAN for the specified number of epochs. Displays the generated images at intervals.

### `ls_discriminator_loss(scores_real, scores_fake)` and `ls_generator_loss(scores_fake)`

Computes the **Least Squares GAN** (LSGAN) loss for the **Discriminator** and **Generator**.

### `test_leaky_relu(x, y_true)`

Tests the **Leaky ReLU** activation function implementation for correctness.

## Example Output

Once the training is completed, the model will generate new images. The following will be shown during training:

* Epoch and iteration numbers.
* Loss values for both the Discriminator and Generator.
* Images generated by the **Generator**.
